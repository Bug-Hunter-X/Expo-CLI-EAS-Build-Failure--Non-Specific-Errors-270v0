This error occurs when using the Expo CLI and involves issues with the EAS (Expo Application Services) build process.  The error message itself might not be very descriptive, often showing a generic failure or timeout. The root cause is usually related to network connectivity, incorrect EAS configuration, or problems with the project's dependencies or build process.  For example, a large project might take a long time to build and timeout before completion.  Or a missing or corrupted dependency might cause the build to fail silently.
