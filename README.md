# Expo CLI EAS Build Failure: Non-Specific Errors

This repository demonstrates a common, yet frustrating, issue with the Expo CLI's EAS build process.  The problem manifests as a generic failure or timeout during the build, often with insufficient information to pinpoint the root cause.  This can be caused by network connectivity problems, incorrect EAS configuration, or issues with project dependencies.

**Reproducing the Issue (Example):**

While this specific code doesn't directly reproduce the error, it showcases a large project that might lead to a timeout, mimicking the issue.

**Possible Solutions:**

* **Check Network Connectivity:** Ensure a stable internet connection.
* **Verify EAS Configuration:** Double-check the `eas.json` file for accuracy.  Incorrect settings for build profiles can lead to failures.
* **Review Dependencies:** Look for any issues with your project's dependencies.  Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to make sure all dependencies are properly installed and resolved.  Consider using `npm ls` or `yarn why` to check the dependency tree and look for conflicting versions or missing packages.
* **Reduce Project Size (if applicable):**  Large projects can exceed build time limits. Try splitting up the project, or optimize assets to reduce build time.
* **Examine Build Logs:** Look for more specific error messages hidden within the build logs (often lengthy). They usually offer more clues than the top-level error message.
* **Contact Expo Support:** If all else fails, report the issue to the Expo support team, along with the complete build logs, your `eas.json` configuration, and your project's `package.json` file.
