// Solution: Comprehensive debugging steps to address the root cause of the generic Expo EAS build errors

// 1. Check Network Connection and Retry:
console.log('Checking network connectivity...');
// Add code here to check network status using a suitable library
// If the network is unstable, wait and try again

// 2. Verify EAS Build Configuration:
console.log('Verifying EAS configuration...');
// Add code here to read and validate the contents of eas.json file
// Provide error messages and guidance if the configuration is invalid or missing

// 3. Run Dependency checks:
console.log('Checking project dependencies...');
// Use npm ls or yarn why to identify conflicts and missing dependencies
// Provide instructions to resolve such issues

// 4. Analyze Build Logs for Deeper Insights:
console.log('Analyzing build logs for more specific error messages...');
// Add code to parse the EAS build logs for errors
// The specific error messages should be parsed and displayed to the user

// 5. Consider Project Size Optimization:
console.log('Consider project optimization techniques to reduce build time...');
// Suggestions: splitting the project into smaller modules, asset optimization

// 6. Contact Expo Support (if necessary):
console.log('If you need additional help, please contact Expo support...');
// Provide links to support resources
// Include suggestions for the information to provide support for better debugging
